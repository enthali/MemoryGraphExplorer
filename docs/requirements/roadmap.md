# Memory Graph Explorer - Development Roadmap

## Vision

Evolve the Memory Graph Explorer into a sophisticated memory management platform with enterprise-grade features, advanced analytics, and multiple deployment options.

## Current State

The Memory Graph Explorer is **fully operational** with:

- ✅ Hybrid HTTP/REST + MCP architecture
- ✅ Docker containerized deployment  
- ✅ GitHub Copilot integration via MCP
- ✅ Web visualization interface
- ✅ Complete CRUD operations on knowledge graphs
- ✅ JSON-based data persistence

**Ready for**: Feature extensions and scaling enhancements

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 1: Business Logic Layer Separation

**Goal:** Separate business logic from MCP protocol interface for better maintainability

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create business logic layer (MemoryService class)
- [ ] Extract validation logic (entity existence checks)
- [ ] Extract graph algorithms (get_node_relations, search optimization)
- [ ] Create data access interface (still using JSON)
- [ ] Update MCP server to use business logic layer
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Test consistency validation (prevent graph explorer breakage)

**Success Criteria:**
- Clean separation: MCP Protocol ↔ Business Logic ↔ Data Access
- Graph explorer no longer breaks on invalid data
- All existing functionality preserved
- Error messages when trying to create invalid relations

**Architecture Target:**
```
MCPServer → MemoryService → JSONDataAdapter → memory.json
```

### Phase 1.5: Relation Observations

**Goal:** Enable observations on relations for richer relationship context and type consolidation

**Use Case:** Replace specific relation types with generic types + detailed observations
```json
// Instead of: "CEO_of", "Senior_Account_Manager_at", "Developer_at"
// Use: "employed_by" + observations: ["CEO"], ["Senior Account Manager"], ["Developer"]
```

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Extend TypeScript `Relation` interface with optional `observations?: string[]`
- [ ] Create `add_observations_to_relations` MCP tool
- [ ] Create `delete_observations_from_relations` MCP tool  
- [ ] Extend `search_nodes` to include relation observations
- [ ] Update KnowledgeGraphManager for relation observation management
- [ ] Test with GitHub Copilot integration

**Success Criteria:**
- Optional observations on relations (backward compatible)
- No data migration required for existing 400+ relations
- Relation type consolidation possible (e.g. multiple "employed_by" with different observation details)
- Search functionality includes relation observations
- GitHub Copilot can add/remove relation observations

**Benefits:**
- Reduces relation type explosion
- Enables richer relationship context
- Maintains data consistency with entity observation patterns
- Facilitates data cleanup and consolidation

### Phase 2: Database Backend Options

**Goal:** Add database backend options for better performance and features

**Options (in priority order):**
1. **SQLite** - Local, file-based, better performance than JSON
2. **PostgreSQL** - Production-ready, excellent graph extensions
3. **Cosmos DB** - Experimentation with cloud graph database

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create DatabaseAdapter interface
- [ ] Implement SQLiteAdapter
- [ ] Add database migration scripts
- [ ] Create environment-based database selection
- [ ] Performance testing and comparison
- [ ] Optional: PostgreSQL adapter
- [ ] Optional: Cosmos DB adapter with Gremlin API

**Success Criteria:**
- Runtime database switching via environment variables
- Performance improvement for large graphs
- Data migration path from JSON
- All adapters pass the same test suite

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

**Goal:** Enterprise-grade features and advanced analytics

**Features:**
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment
- **Graph Algorithms:** Shortest path, clustering, community detection
- **Advanced Visualization:** Timeline views, filtering, search interface
- **Multi-user Support:** Authentication and data isolation
- **Graph Analytics:** Statistics, relationship patterns, insights
- **API Extensions:** REST API alongside MCP protocol
- **Cloud Deployment:** Azure Container Instances, Kubernetes

## Development Constraints

- **Available Time:** 2-4 hours per week
- **Priority:** Tool must remain usable throughout development
- **Approach:** Incremental improvements, no big-bang rewrites
- **Testing:** Use real memory.json data throughout development

## Development Principles

### Architecture Decisions
- **MCP Protocol:** Universal interface for all AI clients
- **Step-by-step approach:** Prioritize working tool over complete architecture
- **JSON-first:** Start with current format, migrate to databases later
- **Docker-first:** Containerization before architectural changes

### Database Selection
- **SQLite:** Best first database upgrade (local, reliable, SQL)
- **PostgreSQL:** Production choice for complex queries and reliability
- **Cosmos DB:** Experimentation platform for learning cloud graph databases

### Quality Focus
- **Focus on value:** Each phase must improve the tool's usability
- **No regression:** Tool must work throughout development
- **Documentation:** Capture decisions and progress for future reference
