# Memory Graph Explorer - Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Memory Graph Explorer project, organized according to software engineering best practices.

## Documentation Structure

### 📋 Requirements
- **[Roadmap](requirements/roadmap.md)** - Project roadmap and future enhancements
- **[User Stories](requirements/user-stories.md)** - Feature requirements from user perspective *(planned)*
- **[API Requirements](requirements/api-requirements.md)** - API specifications and contracts *(planned)*

### 🏗️ Design & Architecture
- **[System Architecture](design/system-architecture.md)** - Current hybrid protocol architecture ✅
- **[Frontend Architecture](design/frontend-architecture.md)** - Web interface design and patterns
- **[Testing Strategy](design/testing-strategy.md)** - Test coverage and quality assurance
- **[Legacy Target Architecture](design/target-architecture-legacy.md)** - Original unified approach (historical)

### 📚 Implementation Guides *(planned)*
- **API Documentation** - REST and MCP endpoint documentation
- **Deployment Guide** - Production deployment instructions
- **Development Setup** - Local development environment setup
- **Configuration Reference** - Environment and configuration options

### 🔍 Traceability *(planned)*
Using [OpenFastTrace](https://github.com/itsallcode/openfasttrace) for requirement traceability:
- **Requirements → Design** - Architecture decision records
- **Design → Implementation** - Code to specification mapping
- **Implementation → Testing** - Test coverage verification
- **Testing → Requirements** - Validation completeness

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown Conventions
- Use semantic headings (H1 for document title, H2 for main sections)
- Include code blocks with language specification
- Add blank lines around lists and headings for proper rendering
- Use relative links for internal documentation references

### Architecture Documents
- Include current implementation status (✅ IMPLEMENTED, 🚧 IN PROGRESS, 📋 PLANNED)
- Provide ASCII diagrams for visual architecture representation
- Document design rationale and trade-offs
- Include technology stack and dependencies

### Requirement Management
- Use requirement IDs for traceability (REQ-001, etc.)
- Link requirements to design decisions
- Maintain requirement status and priority
- Include acceptance criteria for features

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [System Architecture](design/system-architecture.md)** - Understand the overall design
2. **Review [Frontend Architecture](design/frontend-architecture.md)** - Learn the web interface structure
3. **Check [Testing Strategy](design/testing-strategy.md)** - Understand quality assurance approach
4. **See [Roadmap](requirements/roadmap.md)** - View planned features and timeline

## Contributing to Documentation

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Use consistent markdown formatting
3. Include diagrams for complex concepts
4. Link related documents using relative paths
5. Update this index when adding new documentation
